{"name":"Play-module-less","tagline":"Less module for the Play framework","body":"Play LESS module\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis module allows you to use LESS (http://www.lesscss.org) directly in your Play! 1.2.5+ project. The documentation is in /documentation.\r\n\r\n### Caveat emptor\r\n\r\nThe only reason I did this release was to provide myself with updated versions of the play less module. It makes use of unofficial forks Asual's lesscss-engine. \r\nIt does not come with any support nor any promise that it will have the same functionality as Asual's future releases. \r\n\r\nReleases\r\n========\r\n\r\nReleases up to 0.9.1 are in the official Play module repository. Since that is now read-only, new releases are hosted elsewhere.\r\n\r\n* http://lunatech.com/play-module-less/dist/play-less-0.9.2.zip (less-1.3.3)\r\n* http://jpwesselink.github.io/play-module-less/dist/play-less-0.9.3.zip (less-1.5.0)\r\n* http://jpwesselink.github.io/play-module-less/dist/play-less-0.9.4.zip (less-1.5.1)\r\n* http://jpwesselink.github.io/play-module-less/dist/play-less-0.9.5.zip (less-1.6.0)\r\n* http://jpwesselink.github.io/play-module-less/dist/play-less-0.9.6.zip (less-1.6.1)\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011-2013 Lunatech (http://www.lunatech.com).\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this project except in compliance with the License.
